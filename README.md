# Camping Web

Hello everyone,

This project is a sample exercise that I've created based on a training course, the link to which I will provide at the end of this text. In this sample project, which happens to be my very first one, I've utilized HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript to develop a responsive web page related to camping. Throughout the development process, I've aimed to uphold all the development standards, ensuring that the end result not only looks great but also functions smoothly on various devices.

I appreciate your attention and interest.

Best regards.
